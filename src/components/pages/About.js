                What is CRUD?
            </h2>
            <p>CRUD Meaning: CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of computer programming and refers to the four
                functions that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: create, read,
                update
                and delete. Persistent storage refers to any data storage device that retains power after the device is
                powered off, such as a hard disk or a solid-state drive. In contrast, random access memory and internal
                caching are two examples of volatile memory - they contain data that will be erased when they lose
                power.</p>
